### Text Comparison Tool

This is a desktop application for comparing two Spanish text documents (in `.docx` format). The application allows users to load and analyze the texts, and visualize the most frequently occurring words that are either nouns or adjectives. The analysis excludes conjunctions, prepositions, adverbs, and verbs.

#### Features:
- Load two `.docx` files containing Spanish text.
- Analyze the texts to find common words that are either nouns or adjectives.
- Display the 50 most frequently occurring common words.
- Visualize the word frequencies in a bar chart.

#### Dependencies:
- `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface.
- `python-docx`: To read `.docx` files.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing word frequencies.
- `nltk`: For text processing and part-of-speech tagging.

#### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
    ```sh
    pip install tkinter python-docx matplotlib nltk
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python text_comparison_tool.py
    ```
4. Use the "Load File 1" and "Load File 2" buttons to load your `.docx` files.
5. Click the "Analyze and Visualize" button to perform the analysis and display the results.
